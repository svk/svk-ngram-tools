We divide the vocabulary into m bins, equally sized by frequency.
Reasonable values for m are not much larger than 10.

We then split the n-gram data into n**m smaller sorted lists, each
in a separate file, compressed individually.

To make a lookup, we determine the file name by determining the
bin of each token, open this (smaller) file, and search through it.
